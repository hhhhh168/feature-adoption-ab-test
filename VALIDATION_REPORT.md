# A/B Test Portfolio Project - Validation Report

**Project**: Feature Adoption A/B Testing Platform
**Audit Date**: October 30, 2025
**Target Position**: Mid-Level Data Analyst/Scientist (3-5 YOE)
**Focus**: Practical red flags that hurt credibility with hiring managers

---

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates strong statistical methodology and professional code structure, but has **1 critical red flag** and **2 areas needing attention** that could hurt credibility during the hiring manager's 90-second portfolio scan.

### Overall Assessment

- **‚úÖ STRENGTHS**: Traffic split realism, temporal patterns, p-value precision, comprehensive statistical analysis
- **üö® CRITICAL ISSUE**: Baseline conversion rate too high (29.6% vs typical 2-5%)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION NEEDED**: Device type differences too similar, Benford's Law deviation

---

## Part 1: Critical Red Flag Checks

### ‚úÖ CHECK 1: Traffic Split Realism - **PASS**

```
Control:   2,549 (50.98%)
Treatment: 2,451 (49.02%)
```

**Status**: GOOD ‚úì
**Why**: Realistic imperfection (not exactly 50/50), shows natural variance
**Hiring Manager Impact**: Demonstrates awareness that perfect splits are suspicious

**Additional Strength**: SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch) check is implemented in `statistical_analysis.py`, showing knowledge of real-world experiment issues.

---

### üö® CHECK 2: Effect Size Sanity Check - **FAIL**

```
Baseline conversion (control): 29.58%
Treatment conversion:          36.39%
Relative lift:                 23.03%
```

**Status**: RED FLAG üö®
**Issue**: Baseline conversion rate of 29.6% is unrealistic for most A/B tests

**Why This Matters**:
- Real e-commerce/app verification tests typically have 2-5% baseline conversion rates
- Healthcare/high-value conversions: 5-10%
- Your 29.6% baseline would only be realistic for:
  - Very low-friction actions (button clicks, page views)
  - Pre-qualified users (existing customers, invited users)
  - NOT for verification flows

**Impact on Credibility**: üö® **HIGH** - Experienced hiring managers will immediately notice this

**Lift Analysis**:
- 23% relative lift is borderline high but acceptable if baseline were realistic
- For verification flows, 5-15% lifts are typical
- Decimal precision (23.03%) is good, shows it's not artificially rounded

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK 3: Benford's Law Test - **WARNING**

```
Digit | Observed% | Expected% | Diff
--------------------------------------
1     |   51.9%   |  30.1%   | 21.8% ‚ö†Ô∏è
2     |    7.3%   |  17.6%   | 10.3% ‚ö†Ô∏è
3     |    9.1%   |  12.5%   |  3.4%
```

**Status**: WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: Large deviation from Benford's Law on leading digit distribution

**Context**:
- Tested on session counts from events data
- With only 5,000 users (small sample), some deviation is acceptable
- The pattern (too many 1s, too few 2s) suggests the underlying distribution might be Poisson/Gamma with small parameters

**Impact on Credibility**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Technical interviewers may check this, but deviations on small samples are forgivable. More important for large-scale datasets (50K+ users).

**Recommendation**:
- For 5K sample: Monitor but not critical
- For 50K sample: Would need fixing
- Alternative: Document that session counts follow Gamma distribution (which naturally deviates from Benford)

---

### ‚úÖ CHECK 4: Temporal Patterns - **PASS**

```
Daily conversion rate variance:
  Mean: 0.3580
  Std Dev: 0.0769  (7.69% coefficient of variation)
```

**Status**: GOOD ‚úì
**Why**: Natural day-to-day fluctuation present (std dev ~8%)

**What This Shows**:
- Conversion rates aren't perfectly smooth
- Daily variance is realistic
- Not monotonically improving every day (which would be suspicious)

**Weekend Analysis**:
- Weekend data appears sparse (shows as NaN)
- This is acceptable for a 2-week experiment with limited weekend coverage
- No red flag since weekday data shows variance

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK 5: User Segment Differences - **WARNING**

```
Conversion rates by device type:
               control  treatment
device_type
Android      0.277875   0.372157
iOS          0.310493   0.357249

Device conversion ratio: 0.97
```

**Status**: WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: iOS and Android convert at nearly identical rates (97% ratio)

**Why This Matters**:
- Real mobile apps show meaningful device differences
- Typical pattern: iOS users 1.2-1.5x Android conversion (higher engagement, affluent users)
- OR: Android users 0.7-0.9x iOS due to platform friction
- Your data: iOS is 1.12x Android in control, 0.96x in treatment (too similar)

**Impact on Credibility**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM** - Not immediately obvious, but data-savvy reviewers will notice

**Positive Note**: At least there IS some difference between devices, not identical

---

### ‚úÖ CHECK 6: P-value Precision - **PASS**

```
Primary metric p-value: 0.000000 (< 0.000001)
```

**Status**: GOOD ‚úì
**Why**: Has natural precision, not exactly at significance thresholds (0.05 or 0.01)

**What This Shows**:
- P-value is calculated properly, not hard-coded
- Strong statistical significance (expected given large effect size)
- Demonstrates understanding that p-values should have decimal precision

---

## Part 2: Documentation Completeness

### ‚úÖ Clear Statement of Synthetic Nature

**Location**: README.md line 372-373
**Quality**: GOOD ‚úì

```markdown
### Synthetic Data Disclaimer

**This project uses 100% synthetic data generated with the SDV library.**
No real user data is included. The synthetic data is designed to
demonstrate technical capabilities and statistical methodology.
```

**Strengths**:
- Prominently placed in "Important Notes" section
- Clear and unambiguous
- Explains purpose (demonstrate capabilities, not hide anything)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Synthetic Data? - **INCOMPLETE**

**Status**: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current**: States data is for "demonstration purposes"
**Missing**: Stronger justification like:
- "Dating app data contains PII and cannot be shared publicly"
- "Generated to demonstrate A/B testing methodology in privacy-sensitive domain"
- "Allows reproducible results for portfolio evaluation"

**Recommendation**: Add 1-2 sentences explaining WHY synthetic is necessary for this domain

---

### ‚úÖ Business Context - **GOOD**

**Location**: README.md lines 12-26

```markdown
### Business Context
This project models an experiment for a professional dating application
targeting educated professionals...
```

**Strengths**:
- Clear domain explanation
- Specific hypothesis
- Well-defined metrics
- Shows business thinking, not just technical exercise

---

### üö® Tool Documentation - **MISLEADING**

**Location**: README.md line 32

```markdown
- 50,000 realistic user profiles using SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
```

**Issue**: README claims "using SDV" but code uses **manual generation**
**Impact**: üö® **HIGH** - Technical reviewers will spot this discrepancy

**Evidence**:
- `requirements.txt` lists `sdv>=1.2.0` but it's not imported anywhere
- `synthetic_data_generator.py` uses manual numpy/scipy generation
- No `from sdv import` statements in codebase

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Fix README to say "using scipy/numpy statistical distributions"
2. OR actually implement SDV (which would be impressive for portfolio)

**This is the SECOND critical issue to fix.**

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations - **MISSING**

**Status**: NOT DOCUMENTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Recommendation**: Add a "Limitations" section acknowledging:
```markdown
### Known Limitations (Synthetic Data)

- Baseline conversion rate (30%) is higher than typical verification flows (5-10%)
  to ensure sufficient sample size in demo data
- Device type differences simplified for demonstration
- User behavior patterns are simplified compared to production systems
- 2-week timeframe chosen for demo; real experiments often run 4+ weeks
```

**Impact**: Shows self-awareness and honesty, which hiring managers value

---

### ‚úÖ Key Results and Business Impact - **GOOD**

**Location**: README.md lines 313-322

```markdown
| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift | p-value | Significant |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Tier 1 Completion | 40.0% | 46.0% | +15.0% | <0.001 | Yes |
```

**Strengths**:
- Clear results table
- Business recommendation ("SHIP")
- Shows decision-making framework

**Enhancement Opportunity**: Add projected business impact
Example: "15% lift in verification = +3,000 verified users/month = $XX in LTV"

---

## Part 3: Summary of Red Flags

### üö® Critical Issues (Must Fix)

| Issue | Impact | Priority | Estimated Fix Time |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Baseline conversion too high (29.6%)** | High - Hiring managers notice immediately | P0 | 30 mins |
| **SDV claim but manual generation** | High - Credibility damage if discovered | P0 | 15 mins |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention Needed (Should Fix)

| Issue | Impact | Priority | Estimated Fix Time |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Device differences too similar** | Medium - Data-savvy reviewers notice | P1 | 20 mins |
| **Benford's Law deviation** | Low-Medium - Acceptable for small sample | P2 | Optional |
| **Missing limitations section** | Medium - Shows maturity | P1 | 10 mins |

### ‚úÖ Strengths (Keep These)

- ‚úì Realistic traffic split imperfection
- ‚úì SRM check implementation
- ‚úì Natural temporal variance
- ‚úì Proper p-value calculation
- ‚úì Clear synthetic data disclosure
- ‚úì Strong business context
- ‚úì Comprehensive statistical methodology (CUPED, power analysis, multiple testing)

---

## Part 4: Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Baseline Conversion Rate (30 minutes)

**File**: `src/config.py` line 84

**Current**:
```python
tier1_completion_rate: float = 0.40  # 40%
```

**Recommended Change**:
```python
tier1_completion_rate: float = 0.05  # 5% baseline for verification flow
```

**Impact Calculation**:
- New baseline: 5%
- With 15% lift: treatment = 5.75%
- This is realistic for email verification flows
- Will require regenerating data: `python scripts/generate_sample_data.py`

**Alternative** (if you want to keep sample size high):
```python
tier1_completion_rate: float = 0.08  # 8% (higher end but acceptable)
```

---

### Priority 2: Fix SDV Documentation (15 minutes)

**Option A**: Update README to reflect actual implementation

**File**: `README.md` line 32

**Current**:
```markdown
- 50,000 realistic user profiles using SDV (Synthetic Data Vault)
```

**Recommended**:
```markdown
- 50,000 realistic user profiles using scipy/numpy statistical distributions
- Gamma, Beta, Poisson, and Log-normal distributions for realistic variance
```

**Also update line 372**:
```markdown
**This project uses 100% synthetic data generated with scipy statistical
distributions.** No real user data is included.
```

**Option B**: Actually implement SDV (more impressive but optional)
- Would take ~2 hours
- Shows knowledge of industry-standard synthetic data tools
- Could be good enhancement for future

---

### Priority 3: Add Device-Based Conversion Differences (20 minutes)

**File**: `src/synthetic_data_generator.py` around line 386

**Add before calculating completion_rate**:
```python
# Device type effect (iOS converts 1.3x Android)
device_multiplier = 1.3 if user['device_type'] == 'iOS' else 1.0
completion_rate = self.config.tier1_completion_rate * device_multiplier
```

**Result**:
- iOS: ~6.5% baseline (with 5% base)
- Android: ~5% baseline
- Realistic 1.3x difference
- Treatment effect still applies to both

---

### Priority 4: Add Limitations Section to README (10 minutes)

**File**: `README.md` after line 373

**Add**:
```markdown
### Known Limitations

For demonstration purposes, this synthetic dataset includes simplifications:

- **Sample size**: 5,000 users in demo (production would be 50K+)
- **Duration**: 2-week experiment (real verification tests often run 4+ weeks)
- **User segments**: Simplified into 4 engagement tiers (real apps have dozens of cohorts)
- **Verification flow**: Two-tier system simplified from real multi-step flows

These simplifications allow the project to demonstrate statistical methodology
while remaining accessible for portfolio review. The statistical techniques
(CUPED, power analysis, SRM checks) scale directly to production systems.
```

---

## Part 5: Fix Script

I've created `fix_synthetic_data.py` which:

1. ‚úì Adjusts baseline conversion rates to realistic levels (5-8%)
2. ‚úì Adds device type conversion differences (iOS 1.3x Android)
3. ‚úì Adds slight variance to traffic split while keeping it close to 50/50
4. ‚úì Maintains the statistical story and methodology
5. ‚úì Preserves all the good elements (SRM checks, CUPED, etc.)

**To apply fixes**:
```bash
# 1. Update configuration
# Edit src/config.py line 84: tier1_completion_rate = 0.05

# 2. Add device effect to generator
# Edit src/synthetic_data_generator.py around line 386 (see Priority 3 above)

# 3. Regenerate data
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py

# 4. Update README
# Change lines 32 and 372 to remove SDV claims (see Priority 2)

# 5. Add limitations section
# Add to README after line 373 (see Priority 4)

# 6. Verify fixes
python audit_red_flags.py
```

**Expected result after fixes**:
- ‚úÖ All 6 checks should PASS
- ‚úÖ Baseline conversion: 5-8%
- ‚úÖ Device differences: Realistic
- ‚úÖ Documentation: Accurate

---

## Part 6: What Hiring Managers Actually Check

### First 90 Seconds (Critical)

1. **Is it obviously fake?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently YES (29% baseline is a giveaway)
2. **Are numbers realistic?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Effect size okay, baseline too high
3. **Is it documented properly?** ‚úÖ Yes, synthetic nature is clear
4. **Does code look professional?** ‚úÖ Yes, well-structured

### Deep Dive (If You Pass First 90 Seconds)

5. **Statistical awareness?** ‚úÖ YES - SRM checks, CUPED, power analysis
6. **Business thinking?** ‚úÖ YES - Clear hypothesis, metrics, recommendations
7. **Code quality?** ‚úÖ YES - Type hints, tests, documentation

**Current Status**: Project will likely **fail the 90-second scan** due to obvious baseline conversion red flag. After fixes, should **pass easily**.
